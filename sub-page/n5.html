<p>Clare Drakeford, the wife of Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, has died suddenly, the Welsh government has said.

    A spokesman confirmed the news with "deep sadness".
    
    He added: "The thoughts of everyone in the Welsh government are with the family at this time and we ask that their privacy is respected."
    
    Downing Street said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had passed on his "deepest condolences" to Mr Drakeford privately.</p>
<p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was "shocked and saddened" by the news.

    During the pandemic, it was revealed Mr Drakeford had moved from his Cardiff home into a building in his garden to keep his family safe, saying his wife and mother were "vulnerable".
    
    In February 2021, Mr Drakeford said they were in the top four vaccination priority groups "due to their conditions".
    
    Sir Keir added: "On behalf of the whole Labour Party, I send our deepest condolences to Mark and all the family.</p>
<p>"I know just how close they were as a couple, and I can only imagine the sense of loss Mark and the whole family are feeling."

    Mr Drakeford and his family have lived in Pontcanna, Cardiff, for 30 years. The couple have three adult children.
    
    "They are all in our thoughts and prayers," Sir Keir added.</p>
<p>Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "My thoughts are with Mark and his family at this terribly sad time".

    When she and Mrs Drakeford met, she said it was "obvious how strong the bond between her and Mark was".
    
    "I can only imagine the depth of grief he is feeling. Sending him love and strength," she said.
    
    Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, called the news "absolutely devastating".
    
    He offered his "thoughts and prayers" during "this incredibly difficult time".
    
    The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said he was "shocked and deeply saddened" to hear of her death.
    
    "My thoughts and prayers are with Mark Drakeford and his family at this exceptionally difficult time," he said.</p>
<p>"On the occasions I met Clare, she was always a lovely lady and was very warm and kind."

    Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said his heart was "absolutely breaking" for Mr Drakeford.
    "I know how close you were and there are no words to describe the pain you must be feeling," he said.

    "My thoughts are with you and your family. We're all here for you Mark."
    
    Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, Jane Dodds, said her thoughts were with Mr Drakeford and his family at "this very difficult time".</p>
